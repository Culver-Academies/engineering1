# Applications of Engineering 1

Welcome to Applications of Engineering 1!

The course covers three disciplines of engineering: **Aerospace**, **Environmental**, and **Mechatronics**. 
You will learn how to implement and document the **Engineering Design Process** through three projects in which you will design & build various prototypes to test. You will also collect and analyze data from your prototype to improve upon it through iteration. 

You will eventually get to select an engineering career of your choosing and complete a deep dive into what it means to be an engineer. 

My hope is that you become familiar with the knowledge and skills of becoming an engineer to help you decide if it something you wish to pursue.
