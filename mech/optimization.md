# Optimization of Path

The **Mechatronics Design Challenge** will require you to perform a search-and-rescue on a stranded individual while navigating through **extremely dangerous** materials that you must not touch! There are many paths through the dangerous materials and you must decide, using the **engineering design process**, which path to take and then program your TurboPi Robot through the materials safely. In order to determine the best path, you will use trigonometry and science equations to **optimize** for the least amount of time to navigate through the path.
