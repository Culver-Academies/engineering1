# Optimization of a Path

The **Mechatronics Design Challenge** will require you to perform a search-and-rescue mission on a stranded individual while navigating through **extremely dangerous** materials that you must not touch! There are many paths through the dangerous materials and you must decide, using the **engineering design process**, which path to take and then program your TurboPi Robot through the materials safely. In order to determine the best path, you will use trigonometry and science equations to **optimize** for the least amount of time to navigate through the path. 

## Step 1 - Determine the Forward Speed of your TurboPi Robot

The speed of the robot can be determined using the basic speed equation: **Speed (ft/s) = Distance (ft)/Time (s)**

* Program your TurboPi Robot for varying times moving forward (at least five data points) and record in your **Engineering Notebook** using a table. 
* Create a graph of **Distance (ft) vs Time (s)** of the data you collected in your **Engineering Notebook**. Make it as large as an entire page. 
* Calculate the slope of the best-fit line, which will be the **average speed (ft/s)** that you will use for further calculations. 

## Step 2 - Determine the Rotating Speed of your TurboPi Robot


## Step 3 - Calculating the Time to Navigate through a Given Path

## Step 4 - Repeat the Process Multiple Times to Determine the Quickest Path
