# Mechatronics

In this unit you will learn about Mechatronics and what it means to be a Mechatronics Engineer. A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electrical, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system. 

Let's take a look at a couple examples of what mechatronics engineers are involved in:

* InsightTRAC - Robotic Mummy Removal https://www.insighttrac.com/about-us/
* Search and Rescue Robots Saving Lives https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrgEbx6esYE 
* Autonomous Platform for Air and Ground Robots https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrMW0pLl8WY
