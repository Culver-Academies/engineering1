# Arduino

The term **Arduino** can be used to talk about the physical board that has a processor to control motors, sensors, and various electronics *or* it can be used to talk about the software that is used to program the board. You will learn about Arduino (the board and the software) so you are familiar with how it works and to introduce you to some progamming. However, we will be using a **Raspberry Pi** (board) and **Python** (programming language) for our design challenge. 


## Install Arduino IDE from Company Portal

Using Company Portal, installed on your Culver issued laptop, download and install Arduino IDE. It is the software that we will use to design and upload programs to our Arduino board. 


## First Look at Arduino

Read through the following PDF and take notes in your **Engineering Notebook** on the capabilities of an Arduino, the main circuit components of the Arduino board, and basics on how to use them.

## Blink and Add Libraries

Read through the following PDF and take notes in your **Engineering Notebook** on the syntax of the Blink program as well as functions used within the program. You will need to know how to make comments within a program and how to use the following functions: *setup*, *loop*, *digitalWrite*, and *delay*.  Use the Arduino Reference link below to find out more about each function.

### Blink the Onboard LED
Perform the actions described within the PDF with your Arduino board as a team. Take notes in your **Engineering Notebook** on any issues and how you went about resolving them. 

### Action Items
**Demonstrate to your instructor the following:**
* Blink the LED at 60 Hz.
* Blink the LED at 120 Hz.
* At what frequency are you no longer able to detect it blinking?
* Record using slow-motion on your phone to show that it is still blinking.
