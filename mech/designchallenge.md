# Mechatronics Design Challenge

For this challenge you will not be altering the mechanical design of the robot, but instead be designing a program.
Complete the [Mechatronics Unit EDP Portfolio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Culver-Academies/engineering1/main/files/Mechatronics_Unit_Project_EDP_Template_Updated_7-25-24.docx) using the below information. 



## Customer Requirements
- Send a search-and-rescue robot to the destination as **quickly** and **safely** as possible.
  - The robot cannot touch any dangerous items (e.g. cones).
  - The robot should reach the destination in under 10 seconds
 
## Design Constraints
- You must use the TurboPi robot as your search-and-rescue robot
- Your first attempt must include a **time-based** Python code to autonomously control the robot
- Addtional attempts can include sensors, camera, and app controls
- Your code must include proper **comments** throughout

## Search-and-Rescue Obstacle Course
